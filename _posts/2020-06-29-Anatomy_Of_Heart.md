# Anatomy of the Heart 

The heart is between our lungs and our sternum, and it is secured in a double-layered membrane called the **pericardium**. The **epicardium** is the outermost surface of the heart, while the **endocardium** is the innermost surface of the heart. Common words to describe something outside of the heart is **“epicardial”** and toward the inside the heart is **“microvascular.”**

The **aorta** is the largest artery in our body, extending from the **left ventricle** in the heart all the way down to our legs. It starts looping over the heart (**aortic arch**) which starts the **thoracic aorta**. It then extends down to the **abdominal aorta**, and finally bifurcates into the two common **iliac arteries**.   

The **superior vena cava** carries deoxygenated blood from the neck and brain to the heart, consisting of the **brachiocephalic vein**. The **inferior vena cava** is the vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the bottom of the body. Like the aorta, the inferior vena cava bifurcates to the **common iliac veins** to the two legs. The **pulmonary vein** pumps deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle into the lung, and the pulmonary artery takes blood from the lung into the **left atrium**, where it is pumped out. The **coronary arteries** take blood to the heart for it to move. The **marginal arteries** and **posterior descending arteries** are examples of coronary arteries that carry blood to certain parts of the heart.
